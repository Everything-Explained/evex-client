              div.question(mousedown.delegate='getAnswer($event)') why did you create this site
              div.answer.
                You should check out the !{about} page.



            div.qablock
              div.question(mousedown.delegate='getAnswer($event)') what does noumenae mean
              div.answer.
                Noumenae is an invented word from the root word Noumena. Noumena has a very
                difficult definition to wrap ones mind around, but once understood, can lead to
                some very fulfilling realizations.#[br]#[br]
                Noumena means: #[em Something that can be the object only of a purely intellectual],
                #[em nonsensuous intuition].#[br]#[br]
                In laymens terms, you could describe this as an epiphany or experience which has
                no point of concievable origin however it is still very real, but unreal at the
                same time.#[br]#[br]
                In my opinion, this is the way in which our Father communicates. So what better
                word to use for the communication between His people than by using a term which
                describes His communication with us. #[em That is my opinion of course].#[br]#[br]
                If you want to delve into this further, here are some links:#[br]
                !{definition}#[br]
                !{kantianism}#[br]#[br]
                I must stress that I DO NOT subscribe to Kantianism, but I do share in some
                of his philosophical beliefs, a noumenal reality being one of them.

              div.answer.

                in various forums.

              div.question(mousedown.delegate='getAnswer($event)') how do i get an invite
              div.answer.
                Invites are given out by the Admin as well as those who have established some
                integrity on the site. That being said, you're free to email the Admin as described
                on the !{about} page.



            div.qablock
              div.question(mousedown.delegate='getAnswer($event)') why invite only
              div.answer
                span.
                    There are three reasons necessary for this decision. The first is that
                    there are too many people on the internet who enjoy abusing free
                    services. That is the world we live in and as such, I must take that
                    into consideration.
                span.
                    The second, is that with an invite system, we are able to filter out the
                    individuals that might pose more harm than good to the site. This has
                    nothing to do with abuse, but individuals that simply don't have the same
                    moral foundation we expect out of our members and ourselves. Although the
                    restrictions will be leniant, certain individuals will provide too much
                    friction to be beneficial.
                span.
                    The third and final reason, is traffic. Early on in the development of this
                    site, there are going to be traffic restrictions. As more and more people
                    are added, this introduces potential for failure depending on the increase
                    in IO on the server. Once I can assess the average strain per-user on the
                    site, then I can remove this restriction and possibly have higher tier
                    members start inviting more people. This is all pending overall interest, as
                    well as our Fathers blessing.

                span.
                    All of us are here on this planet, on this plane of existence where the majority
                    of our time is spent figuring out what to do next. We are wanting, needing
                    individuals. Noumenae is a place for those who don't feel they belong, who don't
                    feel like things are "right". If you have strong beliefs and an open mind but
                    aren't quite sure where you'll be welcome, then this is probably the place for you.

                    The Sabbath is an integral part of this site and must be at least a modicum
                    portion of your motivation for joining. That, alongside belief in God, are the
                    basic fundamental requirements. If you're lacking faith, but trying to find it,
                    that's okay too. Everyone needs a place to start. Hopefully that place is
                    Noumenae.

              div.answer
                span.
                    The Sabbath, as defined in the dictionary is, in fact, the 7th day of the week.
                    This is the day I, and many others, observe as the "day of rest" provided us
                    when Elohim rested from their creation. As it is written, this day was created
                    for man, not man for the Sabbath. In other words, it's for our sake to take
                    advantage of for our relationship with the Father as well as each other.



            div.qablock
              div.question(mousedown.delegate='getAnswer($event)') what is a family
              div.answer
                span.
                    This is a difficult question, since it's entirely subjective. Each of us has had
                    our own experience with family. We exist, therefore we have a family in one way
                    or another. All I can tell you is how a family SHOULD be, not how families,
                    in fact, are. They should be kind, understanding, and tough. That's from my
                    own experience; your mileage may vary.
                span.
                    Noumenae is a family, insomuch that we care for one another (at least we should)
                    and strive to better one another by either being an example (a light) or through
                    spirited conversation. Families are not perfect and there are going to be tensions
                    but they should be short-lived. The better question would be, "What's the difference
                    between a Human family and a God family".
                span.
                    Try as I might, Noumenae will never reach the status of "God Family", but my
                    Father knows this place is dedicated to Him. If He responds in kind, possibly one
                    day we might know what it is to be a part of a "God Family".



            div.qablock
              div.question(mousedown.delegate='getAnswer($event)') what are messages
              div.answer
                span.
                    When you navigate to the chat panel, you will see text float up on the screen; these
                    are messages. Messages have a number of controls that, depending on your own
                    message count, will either be enabled or disabled. Each user must reach a certain
                    number of messages before all these controls become enabled.
                span.
                    That all seems simple enough right Well...sort of. There are also 4 different
                    #[em types] of messages. There are Quips, Simple, Standard and Complex message
                    types. From those listed types, right to left, they give increasing amounts
                    of Renown. Complex messages give the most and Quips give the least.
                span.
                    You may be wondering "Why not just make them all the same". That's a good question.
                    At first glance that seems the easiest solution, but because the Reonwn system is
                    tailored to recognize substantial contributions, there needs to be more strict
                    criteria. There should be no opportunity for users to "pad" their renown either on
                    purpose or accidently.
                span.
                    As it stands right now, only Standard and Complex messages will count towards
                    unlocks of features. Quips and Simple messages also have a much lower Renown benefit
                    than their more substantial alternatives. Now, this doesn't mean that short messages
                    are not substantial. Some of the most wise words can be said very succinctly, but
                    the Renown system is designed to procure substantial contribution over long periods
                    of time.

              div.answer
                span.
                  When sending a normal message to a channel, everyone in that channel can see the message.
                  Sending a "notice" means you've specified one person to send a message to. This message will
                  still be sent to the channel you're on, but instead of everyone seeing it, only the person
                  you specified will see it.
                span.
                  You can think of it like an inline private message to someone. It's not sent to an inbox or a
                  special window; it's sent directly to the channel like all messages. The difference being that
                  only the person you specified will see it, because their socket (connection) is the only one that
                  will have access to it.

                    Renown is an abstract calculation of a users impact on the site. It can be increased

                span.
                    With a site like this, there needs to be a way to measure contribution
                    either physical or conceptual. Users need to know their presence has
                    an actual impact on the family they're a part of.
                span.
                    Obviously, recieving compliments and making friends has its own reward,
                    but being able to physically "see" your impact in some way, makes your
                    experience all the more "real".

              div.answer
                span.
                    You need to think of Renown as something attained over a vast amount of time.
                    If you think of Heroes or Legends having immense "Renown", it's because of all
                    that they achieved in their lifetime, not a single solitary act. This is the
                    way in which you should view Renown.
                span.
                    Everything (almost) you do on the site, gives you a portion of Renown. Your dedication
                    to the site and its members will reflect in your Renown. Accrue enough Renown
                    and you just might get something special...

                  A silence is when an admin or moderator decides to mute a user
                  for inappropriate content or behavior. The duration of the mute depends on the
                  severity of the infraction. Most mutes will only last 15 - 300 seconds.
                  While a user is muted, they may view, but not participate in the
                  chat. A silence will generally happen when a user is flooding the

                  deleted. There are also temporary bans which prevent any kind
                  of logging in until the duration is reached. Bans will be very
                  rare and reserved for persistent inappropriate conduct and/or
                  an outright defiance of the rules. Only Admins will have the
                  ability to perma ban. Users that are temporarily banned will
                  be under review by an Admin. Again, this is a last resort kind
                  of punishment and should not be expected for the proverbial "spilt milk".
