      div.qablock
        div.question Why did you create this site?
        div.answer You should check out the !{about} page.


      div.qablock
        div.question Who are you?
        div.answer Who I am doesn't really matter. I explain about this on the !{about} page.
                  |If you must know, I'm simply a guy wanting to give back to my Father. You
                  |could say I'm trying to be considerate to His will, in that I want my life
                  |to reflect His will to the best of the ability He gave me. If He blesses this
                  |work, then I know He has acknowledged His will in this work.


      div.qablock
        div.question What makes you think you can claim anything is Gods will?
        div.answer I don't claim any such things. Just like you, I only have my experience
                  |to pull from. If I perceive something as "Gods will" it's my own opinion
                  |and in no way, shape, or form a "claim" to Truth. I don't claim anything
                  |other than to do my best to get as close to Him as I can. He gave me these
                  |gifts and therefore I am using them to connect His people.


      div.qablock
        div.question What do you get out of this site?
        div.answer.
                  If God blesses this site, then I will be earning a living. If He doesn't,
                  then I have to continue to figure out what He expects of me. That being
                  said, this site will only ever run on donations. I despise advertising and
                  I've already established that this is a place to come out of the world,
                  not be burdened by it.


      div.qablock
        div.question What is a living?
        div.answer A living, in my opinion, is not merely an existence, but having a real,
                  |full, life...a life about His will and His people. Hopefully also
                  |someone to call my own.


      div.qablock
        div.question How do I get an Invite?
        div.answer Unless you know someone who has access to invite codes, you cannot gain
                  |access to this site. Check out the requirements for an Invite.


      div.qablock
        div.question Why did you make the site Invite Only?
        div.answer
          span.
              There are three reasons necessary for this decision. The first is that
              there are too many people on the internet who enjoy abusing free
              services. That is the world we live in and as such, I must take that
              into consideration.#[br]#[br]
          span.
              The second, is that with an invite system, we are able to filter out the
              individuals that might pose more harm than good to the site. This has
              nothing to do with abuse, but individuals that simply don't have the same
              moral foundation we expect out of ourselves and this family. Although the
              restrictions will be leniant, certain individuals will provide too much
              friction to be beneficial.#[br]#[br]
          span.
              The third and final reason, is traffic. Early on in the development of this
              site, there are going to be traffic restrictions. As more and more people
              are added, this introduces potential for failure depending on the increase
              in IO on the server. Once I can assess the average strain per-user on the
              site, then I can remove this restriction and possibly have higher tier
              members start inviting more people. This is all pending overall interest, as
              well as the Fathers blessing.



      div.qablock
        div.question What are the requirements for an Invite?
        div.answer
          span.
              The requirements are based on those who've been tasked with giving out
              the invites. Specifically, we only want those who believe in the
              7th day Sabbath (Saturday) and uphold morality above expectation.#[br]#[br]
          span.
              Realistically speaking, we want to bring #[b Good] people together. I'm
              not going to define #[b Good] here, but it is the same #[b Good] used
              in Genesis to describe Elohim's creation of the Earth. Obviously, there are
              none #[b Good] except the Father, but all members of this site should
              be considered by each-other to be "Good" people. There should be no black
              sheep among us.#[br]#[br]
          span.
              You should have a desire to know the Father, not one to gossip or
              meddle in others beliefs. If you're in need of an online family,
              petition me via email.


      div.qablock
        div.question What is the Sabbath?
        div.answer
          span.
              The Sabbath, as defined in the dictionary is, in fact, the 7th day of the week.
              This is the day I, and many others, observe as the "day of rest" provided us
              when Elohim rested from their creation. As it is written, this day was created
              for man, not man for the Sabbath. In other words, it's for our sake to take
              advantage of for our relationship with the Father as well as each other. Iron
              sharpens Iron.


      div.qablock
        div.question What is family?
        div.answer
          span.
              This is a difficult question, since it's entirely relative. Each of us has had
              our own experience with family. We exist, therefore we have a family in one way
              or another. All I can tell you is how a family SHOULD be, not how families,
              in fact, are. They should be kind, understanding, and tough. That's from my
              own experience; your mileage may vary.
          span.
              Amenaeble is a family, insomuch that we care for one another (at least we should)
              and strive to better one another by either being an example (a light) or through
              spirited conversation. Families are not perfect and there are going to be tensions
              but they should be short-lived. The better question would be, "What's the difference
              between a Human family and a God family?".
          span.
              Try as I might, Amenaeble will never reach the status of "God Family", but my
              Father knows I'm going to try my best to reach His standards. As inherently fallible
              as we are, I have to hold out hope that my Father will be where we are joining
              in His name. Then and only then, will it be a "God Family".



      div.qablock
        div.question What is a message?
        div.answer When you're logged into the chat panel, the content that is displayed
                  |from other users, are messages. Each message has their own controls
                  |and attributes. Each time a user sends a message, that user gains
                  |some renown.


      div.qablock
        div.question What is renown?
        div.answer.
                  Renown is an abstract calculation of a users impact on the site
                  through Respecting, Liking, Loving, Messaging, etc...

      div.qablock
        div.question Why have renown at all?
        div.answer
          span.
              With a site like this, there needs to be a way to measure contribution
              either physical or conceptual. Users need to know their presence has
              an actual impact, that they contribute to the family.#[br]#[br]
          span.
              Obviously, having other users say nice things about you or making friends
              with you has its reward, but being able to physically "see" that
              impact in some way, makes the experience all the more visceral
              and interactive.

      div.qablock
        div.question Why is renown so small?
        div.answer
          span.
              Renown is meant to be a measurment of growth over long periods
              of time, therefore it's measured to 3 decimal places. I thought
              about going with 100's or 1000's of renown, but this site
              is based around the longevity of its users. We become a family
              by being around each-other for great lengths. I wanted to reflect
              this by having a variable that measures not only contribution, but
              the length of time a user has been active on the site.#[br]#[br]
          span.
              If a user has 20 renown, versus another user with 5, you will know
              immediately that the user with 20 renown has been around a LONG time
              to accrue that much renown, given the difficulty of accruing
              that much.


      div.qablock
        div.question What is respect?
        div.answer
          span Respect can be seen as a "+1" or "upvote" on someones message. This
              |should only be used when a user has shared or expressed an idea or
              |content that is deserving of your praise. Give as much as you wish,
              |within reason :)
          ul.list-outer
            li Rate of respect is limited to 3 per minute.
            li A message can only recieve one Respect per user.
            li A user must have at least 70 messages to Respect


      div.qablock
        div.question What is abuse?
        div.answer
          span Abuse is similar, but NOT the same as, a down-vote. Down voting
              |assumes that the message recieving the down-vote is dissatisfactory
              |in some way. Abuse, however, means a user has directly abused
              |the site or a user on the site in some way. Giving an abuse
              |modifier is not to be taken lightly and as such, will require
              |users to input a small message as to why they are assigning abuse.
          ul.list-outer
            li Messages may only recieve one abuse per user.
            li Users are required to enter a reason.
              ul.list-inner
                li Reasons must be at least 20 chars long
                li Reasons must be no longer than 140 chars long
            li Users must have at least 133 messages to assign Abuse


      div.qablock
        div.question What is a like?
        div.answer
          span This should be reserved for an incredible contribution, generally
              |of a personal nature. If a user likes another user, their name
              |will appear on the profile of the user they liked.
          ul.list-outer
            li Likes may only be given once every 2 weeks, per user.
            li Users must have at least 333 messages to Like other users.

      div.qablock
        div.question What is a love?
        div.answer
          span This should be reserved for people who have consistently
              |contributed "Good" content on the site for a while; whether
              |it's advice, news, debate, or just being an inspiration to
              |others. This is the highest level of appreciation anyone
              |can receive on the site.
          ul.list-outer
            li Users can only receive love once a month.
            li Love can only be given once a month per user.
            li Users must have at least 3333 messages before they can Love.
            li Certain modifiers may apply that reduce limitations.


      div.qablock
        div.question What is a warning?
        div.answer A warning means an Admin or Moderator has deemed a user defiant or
                  |seriously neglegent regarding the rules. Once a user accrues enough
                  |warnings more serious measures (kick, ban) will be considered.


      div.qablock
        div.question What is a silence?
        div.answer A silence is when an admin or moderator decides to mute a user
                  |for inappropriate content. The duration of the mute depends on the
                  |severity of the infraction. Most mutes will only last 15 - 300 seconds.
                  | While a user is muted, they may view, but not participate in the
                  |chat. A silence will generally happen when a user is flooding the
                  |chat repeatedly (too quickly or with repeated content).


      div.qablock
        div.question What is a kick?
        div.answer A kick is when a user is booted from the chat server for a
                  |specific duration set by an admin or moderator. When a
                  |user is kicked, they may not log into the chat server, however
                  |they can still remain logged into their account and view the
                  |site.


      div.qablock
        div.question What is a ban?
        div.answer A ban is when a user is forced out of the site and potentially
                  |deleted. There are also temporary bans which prevent any kind
                  |of logging in until the duration is reached. Bans will be very
                  |rare and reserved for persistent inappropriate conduct and/or
                  |an outright defiance of the rules. Only Admins will have the
                  |ability to perma ban. Users that are temporarily banned will
                  |be under review by an Admin. Again, this is a last resort kind
                  |of punishment and should not be expected for "spilt milk".
