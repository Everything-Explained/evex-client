      div.qablock
        div.question Why did you create this site?
        div.answer You should check out the !{about} page.


      div.qablock
        div.question Who are you?
        div.answer Who I am doesn't really matter. I explain about this on the !{about} page.
                  |If you must know, I'm simply a guy wanting to give back to my Father. You
                  |could say I'm trying to be considerate to His will, in that I want my life
                  |to reflect His will to the best of the ability He gave me. If He blesses this
                  |work, then I know He has acknowledged His will in this work.


      div.qablock
        div.question What makes you think you can claim anything is Gods will?
        div.answer I don't claim any such things. Just like you, I only have my experience
                  |to pull from. If I perceive something as "Gods will" it's my own opinion
                  |and in no way, shape, or form a "claim" to Truth. I don't claim anything
                  |other than to do my best to get as close to Him as I can. He gave me these
                  |gifts and therefore I am using them to connect His people.


      div.qablock
        div.question What do you get out of this site?
        div.answer If God blesses this site, then I will be earning a living. If He doesn't,
                  |then I have to continue to figure out what He expects of me.


      div.qablock
        div.question What is a living?
        div.answer A living, in my opinion, is not merely an existence, but having a real,
                  |full, life...a life about His will and His people. Hopefully also
                  |someone to call my own.

      div.qablock
        div.question How do I get an Invite?
        div.answer Unless you know someone who has access to invite codes, you cannot gain
                  |access to this site. Check out the requirements for an Invite.


      div.qablock
        div.question Why did you make the site Invite Only?
        div.answer There are two reasons for this. The most obvious reason is because of
                  | spam. I want the user experience to be as clean as possible. If I have to
                  | deal with fake accounts, this will pollute the atmosphere I set out
                  | to create. The second reason is safety. I want every user on the site to
                  | know when they log in, they're not going to be met with contention. We
                  | should be striving #[b with] each other, not #[b against] one another.
                  | one another. Invites will allow a select few individuals to grow
                  | the community.


      div.qablock
        div.question What are the requirements for an Invite?
        div.answer The requirements are based on those who've been tasked with giving out
                  |the invites. Specifically, we only want those who believe in the
                  |7th day Sabbath (Saturday) and uphold morality above expectation.
                  | Realistically speaking, we want to bring "Good" people together. I'm
                  |not going to define "Good" here, but it is the same "Good" used
                  |in Genesis to describe Elohim's creation of the Earth.
                  |You should have a desire to know the Father, not one to gossip or
                  |meddle in others beliefs. If you're in need of an online family,
                  |petition me via email.


      div.qablock
        div.question What is a message?
        div.answer When you're logged into the chat panel, the content that is displayed
                  |from other users, are messages. Each message has their own controls
                  |and attributes. Each time a user sends a message, that user gains
                  |some renown.


      div.qablock
        div.question What is renown?
        div.answer Renown is an arbitrary stat calculation that measures your overall
                  |impact on the site and its users. Users with more renown have
                  |simply contributed more to the site.


      div.qablock
        div.question What is respect?
        div.answer Respect can be seen as a "+1" or "upvote" on someones message. This
                  |should only be used when a user has shared or expressed an idea or
                  |content that is deserving of your praise. Respect is restricted to
                  |3 per minute, per user. Give as much as you wish, within reason :)


      div.qablock
        div.question What is a like?
        div.answer This should be reserved for an incredible contribution, generally
                  |of a personal nature. If a user likes another user, their name
                  |will appear on their liked users public profile as having liked
                  |that user. Giving likes is restricted to once per month, per user.
                  | This may be increased in the future.


      div.qablock
        div.question What is a love?
        div.answer This should be reserved for people who have consistently
                  |contributed "Good" content on the site for a while; whether
                  |it's advice, news, debate, or just being an inspiration to
                  |others. This is the highest level of appreciation anyone
                  |can receive on the site.


      div.qablock
        div.question What is a warning?
        div.answer A warning means an Admin or Moderator has deemed a user defiant or
                  |seriously neglegent regarding the rules. Once a user accrues enough
                  |warnings more serious measures (kick, ban) will be considered.


      div.qablock
        div.question What is a silence?
        div.answer A silence is when an admin or moderator decides to mute a user
                  |for inappropriate content. The duration of the mute depends on the
                  |severity of the infraction. Most mutes will only last 15 - 300 seconds.
                  | While a user is muted, they may view, but not participate in the
                  |chat. A silence will generally happen when a user is flooding the
                  |chat repeatedly (too quickly or with repeated content).


      div.qablock
        div.question What is a kick?
        div.answer A kick is when a user is booted from the chat server for a
                  |specific duration set by an admin or moderator. When a
                  |user is kicked, they may not log into the chat server, however
                  |they can still remain logged into their account and view the
                  |site.


      div.qablock
        div.question What is a ban?
        div.answer A ban is when a user is forced out of the site and potentially
                  |deleted. There are also temporary bans which prevent any kind
                  |of logging in until the duration is reached. Bans will be very
                  |rare and reserved for persistent inappropriate conduct and/or
                  |an outright defiance of the rules. Only Admins will have the
                  |ability to perma ban. Users that are temporarily banned will
                  |be under review by an Admin. Again, this is a last resort kind
                  |of punishment and should not be expected for "spilt milk".
