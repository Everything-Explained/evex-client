# (UPDATE DATE FOR PRODUCTION)

> - DON'T FORGET

# NEW LAYOUT

> - **Paginated Deliciousness** - The _Changelog_, _FAQ_, _Blog_, and _Home_ pages have been converted to a new layout. These pages have dynamic data which will be converted into a nice looking layout for you to peruse.
> - Accompanying the new look, is the ability to link to each of the dynamic pages. _Clicking_ a change log will now change the URL and you can share that URL with **anyone**!

> - **Don't like your alias?** - Well, now you can change it! Just go into your [Settings] page and click the _edit icon_ next to your alias. A slick little box will appear, which will allow you to fiddle around. **Have at it!!**

# CHAT OVERHAUL

> - **Did someone say ___SCALE___? -** The scaling system now actually scales the size of the text, not just your avatar. Because the avatar is the most visible object in chat, it will now stay at an adaquate **48x48** pixels. To scale the chat, simply type `/scale large`; you an do this all the way up to `largest`.

> - **All the changes... -** Every message type has been modified to look a bit more unique. **Notices**, **Emotes**, and even **Normal Messages**, have their own special look now. Colors have also been updated to be more _vibrant and obvious_, yet **not** so bright that it smashes your eyes.

> - **More appendages... -** So back in the [Fate] release, I added message-appending support. This worked well, but it left out the time data. In this release, messages will only be allowed to append up to **45 seconds** after the first message. _No more infinitely long messages_...and **especially** no more reason to wonder how long ago someone sent a message within a block.

> - **Mmmmm...essage Styles -** The normal message is nice because it shows the avatar, but what if you need more screen space? That's where the **"inline"** style comes into play. Check it out with the `/style inline` command.
> - You can always change it back with the `/style normal` command. Commands that change the interface are currently temporary, so when you leave the page or close the window, _the next time you view chat_, ___everything will be default___.

# UNDER THE HOOD

> - **The Greatest Overhaul** - This project began as my first foray into [MVC]. I was going to be a part of something new and quite possibly unique, called [Aurelia]. When the rose-colored glasses came off, all I saw was a hot mess. Because of this, I’ve converted the entire project into [Vue]. It’s extendable and flexible in ways that are most intuitive for perpetual development, which is exactly what I needed.
