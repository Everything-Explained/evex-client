# new layout

> - **Paginated Deliciousness** - The _Changelog_, _FAQ_, _Blog_, and _Home_ pages have been converted to a new layout. These pages have dynamic data which will be converted into a nice looking layout for you to peruse.
> - Accompanying the new look, is the ability to link to each of the dynamic pages. `CLICKING` a change log will now change the URL and you can share that URL with **anyone**!

# under the hood

> - **The Greatest Overhaul** - This project began as my first foray into [MVC]. I was going to be a part of something new and quite possibly unique, called [Aurelia]. When the rose-colored glasses came off, all I saw was a hot mess. Because of this, I’ve converted the entire project into [Vue]. It’s extendable and flexible in ways that are most intuitive for perpetual development, which is exactly what I needed.
