Hello and welcome to Everything Explained. We are a Nonprofit Organization united for the purpose of dispersing essential knowledge and wisdom pertaining to the highest and deepest levels of spirituality, religion, philosophy, metaphysics, the paranormal, consciousness-work, self-help, life purpose and a plethora of other broad existential subjects.

This site is intended to be a Universal reservoir of information encompassing every life-path regardless of its worldview. Every person as well as their path is accepted and warmly-welcomed here.

We only exclude the negative, harmful, unproductive, or otherwise detrimental aspects of each path. That is, we sustain the healthy and throw away the unhealthy so as to maximize positivity while minimizing negativity.

Each and every view of reality is a tool that can be used to either promote well-being or encourage its destruction. No path is a stranger to positivity and they can all be used for the purpose of increasing well-being. Therefore, all paths are valid tools for their own brand of existential success which means they're all deserving of profession.

Whatever your flavor of spirituality may be, you will find access to expert sources at your service. There is no other organization on the planet offering such extensive knowledge about such a vast variety of spiritual fields as you'll uncover here.
