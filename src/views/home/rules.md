LOVE
: One rule to "Rule" them all. ___Show Love for one another___; there is no rule greater than this. The rules below are explicit reminders for those moments when we forget to love.

LANGUAGE
: > **1.1**
  >> This is something with 1.1

  > **1.2**
  >> Using provocative language such as cussing or cursing will only be tolerated within the proper context of personal expression (when it's appropriate). Keep in mind that it's not appropriate most of the time.

  > **1.3**
  >> Any language that violates 1.1 will NOT be tolerated; this includes language barriers. _(ex: cursing in spanish to an english speaking person)_

  > **2.1**
  >> All our members have a right to be as anonymous as they wish. Provoking a member to divulge personal details about themselves is forbidden.

  > **3.1**
  >> Currently, English is the preferred lanugage of Noumenae. If you wish to have a discussion in another language, you're welcome to create your own channel on the site. _(Personal channels are still a work in progress)_

~~break~~

LINKING
: > **1.1**
  >> All links should be constructive and non-provocative. This depends highly on the context of the channel. Most links are okay in the general chat as long as they don't violate any previous or following rules.

  > **2.1**
  >> All images should be appropriate for the channel they're posted in.

  > **2.2**
  >> Images that are provocative or [NSFW], should not be linked, talked about, or hinted at in any way.

  > **2.3**
  >> A provocative or [NSFW] image may be discussed, or in some cases linked, ONLY if the context of the discussion warrants it. In such a case, the image (if linked) must be behind spoilers.

  > **2.4**
  >> Any provocative or [NSFW] images that are illegal or potentially illegal are forbidden, regardless of the context of a discussion.

FUN
: What's the point of bringing people together of similar mind and love if we can't find the laughter and the joy? This is what Noumenae is about; converging on the joy from the wellspring of our **God-given-love** that is within all of us, bursting out to be discovered. Share the passion, the heartache, and the revelation. All of it is God-within, letting the world know He's always been here.
