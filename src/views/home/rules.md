LOVE
: One rule to "Rule" them all. ___Practice Love for one another___. We're not perfect, so **practicing** love is the best we can hope for. Because _we're subject to the ebb and flow of this life_, sometimes we're incapable of showing Love; the explicit rules below are for those difficult moments.

LANGUAGE
: > **1.1**
  >> Using provocative language such as cussing or cursing will only be tolerated within the proper context of personal expression (when it's appropriate). Use common sense.

  > **1.2**
  >> Any language that violates 1.1 will NOT be tolerated; this includes language barriers. _(ex: cursing in spanish to an english speaking person)_

  > **2.1**
  >> All our members have a right to be as anonymous as they wish. Provoking a member to divulge personal details about themselves is forbidden.

  > **3.1**
  >> Currently, English is the preferred lanugage of Noumenae. If you wish to have a discussion in another language, private chat will be available in the future. _(Personal channels are still a work in progress)_

~~break~~

LINKING
: > **1.1**
  >> All links should be constructive and non-provocative. This depends highly on the context of the channel. Most links are okay in the general chat as long as they don't violate any previous or following rules.

  > **2.1**
  >> All images should be appropriate for the channel they're posted in.

  > **2.2**
  >> Images that are provocative or [NSFW], should not be linked, talked about, or hinted at in any way.

  > **2.3**
  >> A provocative or [NSFW] image may be discussed, or in some cases linked, ___Only___ if the context of the discussion warrants it. In such a case, the image (if linked) must be behind spoilers. _(Spoilers are currently not implemented)_

  > **2.4**
  >> Any provocative or [NSFW] images that are illegal or potentially illegal are forbidden, regardless of the context of a discussion.

FUN
: ___Enjoy each other!___ We're here for a short time and each of us has our own unique perspective and experiences. Let us revel in these experiences together; let us revel in the **joy**, the **laughter**, the **tears**, the **heartache**, the **revelation**. All of it is us. All of it is for us to know who we are, so ___let's share it and figure it out together!___
