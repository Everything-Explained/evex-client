title: about bans
author: Jaeiya

A ban is when a user is _temporarily_ or _permanately_ **blacklisted** from being a user of **Noumenae**. Banned users will not be able to login to the site, but they can still view any of the static pages that do not require a login.

Because **Noumenae** is an _invite-only_ service, Bans are **highly unlikely** to be necessary. That being said, temporary Bans might be used in extreme cases. If a user tries to login during a temporary ban, they will be shown the countdown time until they are unbanned.

There will be no Banning over the proverbial _"spilt milk"_. Banning is reserved for **repeated**, severe infractions of the [Rules].

> No bans will be given out unless absolutely necessary.
