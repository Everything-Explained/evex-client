## WHAT IS XP
**XP** stands for **Experience Points** and you gain them by chatting. This is a standard mechanism for most RPG games, which reward XP for doing things in the game or platform.

## WHY NOT GAIN XP FOR EVERY MESSAGE
This is not only to prevent spamming, but also to roughly timestamp levels. Because _it takes 60 seconds to gain XP_, there's a limit on how quickly you can level. As an example, the current calculation for the first level progression is _~1 hours worth of messages_. **This prevents rapid leveling for those who have lots of time on their hands**.

> No matter how much time someone has, it will take **~1 hours worth of messages to get to level 1**.

You may be thinking that _1 hour_ isn't very much time, but that's only if you're **consistently** sending a message every 60 seconds or less. Most people chat in fits and spurts, so on average it will be fairly difficult to maximize XP gain.

##### WIP : This implementation is very experimental until more data is collected, so times and amounts may change.
