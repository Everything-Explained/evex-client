## WHAT ARE LEVELS
When we talk about levels in **Noumenae** we're talking about **Message Levels**. When you send a message using chat, you have a chance to gain some [XP] towards the next level. Each level comes with its own title and each title relates to the users contribution to the site.

Although it sounds nice to gain points everytime you send a message, this is not the case. You only have a *chance* to gain points, so as to prevent any spamming. **Not all messages give you points**.

> Higher level does **NOT** mean better messages; it just means more time spent chatting.
