## WHAT IS A FAMILY
A family takes your hand when you can't move; a family knocks you off that _"high horse"_; a family knows how to _love the joy and the hurt_; a family _embraces_ all its members as one; a _real_ family pushes you to run **headlong** into life, without a care for how it looks to others.

For me, and I think for many, a family stands on _the strength_ of _the belief_ in _the Self_. The Self is that part of us which holds the key to creativity and fulfillment. It's the families job to pull that out of each other.
