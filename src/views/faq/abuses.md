Abuse is similar, but **not** the same as a down-vote. _Down-voting_ in most systems is a way for a user to express their general dislike for a message, warranted or unwarranted. **Abuse** however, means a _user has knowingly ignored the site rules and/or is abusing other users on the site_. Giving an abuse modifier is **not to be taken lightly** and as such, will require users to input a small message as to why they are assigning abuse.
