title: about renown
author: Jaeiya

Renown is an abstract calculation of a users impact on the site. It can be increased through not only activity on the site, but various interactions between users.

> You can gain Renown by chatting, collecting sheep, and recieving upvotes on your messages.

# ?: what is its purpose

_Feedback_; it's nice to recieve compliments and make friends, but those relationships are subjective. _Renown_ is an objective way to quantify contribution to **Noumenae** and its members. _Renown_ allows others to see how you've impacted the site regardless of your interaction with them.

# ?: why is gaining renown slow

You should think of _Renown_ as something attained over a vast amount of time. If you think of **Heroes** or **Legends** having _immense Renown_, it's because of all they achieved in their lifetime, not a single solitary act. This is the way in which you should view _Renown_.

_Almost_ everything you do on the site, gives you a portion of _Renown_. Your dedication to the site and its members will reflect in it. Accrue enough and you just might get something special...

> That **Something Special** is still a WIP and will be available at a much later date.
