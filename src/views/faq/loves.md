## WHAT IS A LOVE
**Love** means many things to different people, in how we share it and receive it, but there is one thing that we can all agree on; **we desire it**. Because of this desire, we **win**, **lose**, **fall-short** or *rise to the occasion*. Noumenae holds that **Love is unconditional** and therefore allows you to give as much as you want to its users.

You're allocated an amount of **Love per day** which you can then send to any users on the site, for any reason at all. You can give it all away or you can store it up; it's entirely up to you. The only requirement is that you're chatting.

## WHY IS THERE A LOVE-PER-DAY LIMIT
If users were allowed to give as much as they wanted, that would lead to some seriously ___huge___ numbers which would inevitably prevent the server from working properly. Setting a threshold also provides for better analytics about how users are spending their **Love**.

## WHAT WILL YOU DO WITH LOVE-ANALYTICS
Make them public to ___You___. It's your data, so you should be able to see the patterns in your own information. The purpose of the data is simply a curiocity to understand how people might be viewing their **Love**. *No usernames will be divulged in the process*.

> Contrary to **Love's** original concept, it will no longer increase **Renown**.

##### WIP : Users will receive 100 love to give per 24 hours.

##### WIP : A proof of concept that is not applicable to the current release.
