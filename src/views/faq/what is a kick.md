title: about kicks
author: Jaeiya

A kick is when a user is forceably removed _from a channel_ on the chat server for a specific duration, set by an **Admin** or **Moderator**. A **kick** is temporary and you may join the channel again when the duration has expired.

> Trying to repeatedly join the channel after you have been kicked will increase the duration

##### WIP : There will be an obvious time limit for channel kicks eventually

##### WIP : Kicks are currently impossible
