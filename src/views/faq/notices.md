title: notices
author: Jaeiya

We all know what a public message is. You type something in the input box and hit enter; *that message is then sent to everyone in the channel*. A **Notice** is when you add a command and name to that message, like so: `/notice username message`, where username is replaced by the **name of the user** you want to send a notice to and *message*, is replaced with the message you want to send to that user.
