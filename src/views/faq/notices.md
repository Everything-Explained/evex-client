title: notices
author: Jaeiya

When sending a message to a channel, everyone sees it. Notices allow you to single out one person in a channel and send them a message directly. The difference between this kind of message and a **private message**, is that a notice is channel-specific. You can only send a notice to a user if they're _in the same channel as you are_.

You can think of it like an inline private message to someone. It's not sent to an inbox or a special window; it's sent directly to the channel like all messages. The difference being that only the person you specified will see it, because their socket (connection) is the only one that will have access to it.

You're probably wondering _Well how do I notice someone?_ This is very simple. All you have to do is **double click** a users name in your user list. This will cause your input box to now contain a command and ID. Just start typing your message and hit enter. Don't worry about not getting a confirmation, that's just how it works right now. In the future you'll get a message saying that your notice was sent successfully.

##### WIP : The current method by which you send a notice will be updated in the future to be much more user friendly.
