Invites are given out by the Admin as well as those who have established some integrity on the site. That being said, you're _free to email the Admin_ as described on the [Welcome] page.

> The Requirements below are just loose guidelines; **content of character** is most important.

## WHAT ARE THE REQUIREMENTS
Noumenae is a harbor for those who feel their flesh isn't all there is, especially when that **flesh is tearing at their soul**. All of us are struggling with _something_, desiring a solace from worry and doubt. This restlessness that we feel from the depth of our being, this _nagging tug_...if you feel such a pull, then **Noumenae** might be what you're looking for.

We call this invisible tension _God_ or _Spirit_ or _Divine_ and we deem it **unseen** or **unknown**. Even though we don't see and we don't know, deep down we feel we _should_ see and _should_ know. If these are the kinds of questions you're asking, the kind of life you're living, or the kind of thoughts you're pondering, then fill out the [Invitation Form].

## WHY INVITE ONLY
The second, is that with an invite system, we are able to filter out individuals that might pose more harm than good to the site. **This has nothing to do with [abuse]**, but individuals that simply don't have a good grasp on what it means to be respectful or accepting. Although the restrictions will be leniant, certain individuals will provide too much friction to be beneficial.

The third and final reason, is **traffic**. Early on in development, there are going to be traffic restrictions. As more and more people are added, this introduces potential for failure depending on the increase in IO on the server. Once I can assess the average strain per-user on the site, then I can remove this restriction and possibly have higher tier members start inviting more people. _This is all pending overall interest._
