title: the faq
author: Jaeiya

On the left, are a list of topics which contain questions, **some obvious and some not-so-obvious**. I would suggest anyone coming here for the first time, familiarize yourself with each topic so that if anything is added, you know where to go. In future releases, there will be a search function that searches **all** of the content for keywords; for now, you have to do it manually, _sorry_!

One handy feature that **is** available, is the _hover_ feature of these individual paragraphs. Go ahead and hover your mouse over this paragraph; it should light up. This will allow you to keep your place while reading, as well as make the text stand out more.

Using the forward and back buttons on your browser or mouse, will allow you to flip through the browser history of clicked questions. To test this out, click any of the questions on the left, then hit the back button on your browser or mouse. You should be navigated back to this answer.

The FAQ will often reference other answers using links. Clicking [XP] or [Levels] will immediately replace this content with those topics. You can always come right back to this answer by hitting the back button on your browser or mouse; **Try it now!**

External links look identical to page links, but they will open up a _new Window or Tab_. Here is the [Definition of a Cat]. After you're done looking at the definition, _you can close that tab/window_ and you should be looking at this page again.

##### WIP : Messages like this give work-in-progress information about a feature or function

**That's all there is to it! Enjoy the FAQ!**
