# what are messages

When you navigate to the chat panel, you will see text float up on the screen; these are messages. Messages have a number of controls that, depending on your own message count, will either be enabled or disabled. Each user must reach a certain number of messages before all these controls become enabled.

That all seems simple enough right Well...sort of. There are also 4 different _types_ of messages. There are **Quips**, **Simple**, **Standard** and **Complex** message types. From those listed types, right to left, they give increasing amounts of Renown. Complex messages give the most and Quips give the least.

You may be wondering _"Why not just make them all the same"_. That's a good question. At first glance that seems the easiest solution, but because the Reonwn system is tailored to recognize substantial contributions, there needs to be more strict criteria. There should be no opportunity for users to "pad" their renown either on purpose or accidently.

As it stands right now, only Standard and Complex messages will count towards unlocks of features. Quips and Simple messages also have a much lower Renown benefit than their more substantial alternatives. Now, this doesn't mean that short messages are not substantial. Some of the most wise words can be said very succinctly, but the Renown system is designed to procure substantial contribution over long periods of time.
