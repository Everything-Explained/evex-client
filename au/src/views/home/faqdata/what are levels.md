# what are levels

When we talk about levels in **Noumenae** we're talking about **Message Levels**. When you send a message using chat, you have a chance to gain some [XP] towards the next level. Each level comes with its own name and each name relates to how invested a user is in chatting.

> Higher level does NOT mean better messages; it just means more time spent chatting.
