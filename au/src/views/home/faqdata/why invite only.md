# why invite only

There are three reasons **necessary** for this decision. The first is that there are too many people on the internet who enjoy abusing free services. That is the world we live in and as such, I must take that into consideration.

The second, is that with an invite system, we are able to filter out the individuals that might pose more harm than good to the site. This has nothing to do with abuse, but individuals that simply don't have the same moral foundation we expect out of our members and ourselves. Although the restrictions will be leniant, certain individuals will provide too much friction to be beneficial.

The third and final reason, is traffic. Early on in the development of this site, there are going to be traffic restrictions. As more and more people are added, this introduces potential for failure depending on the increase in IO on the server. Once I can assess the average strain per-user on the site, then I can remove this restriction and possibly have higher tier members start inviting more people. This is all pending overall interest, as well as our Fathers blessing.
