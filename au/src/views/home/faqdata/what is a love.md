# what is a love

**Love** is a big part of **Noumenae** and as such, it is a trackable stat on the site; however, it is free. There are no limitations on how much **Love** one can give or recieve. **Noumenae** encourages that **Love** be given when any user contributes something meaningful to you personally. When you give **Love**, it will increase not only their love stat, but your _love-given_ stat.

Originally **Love** points were going to be aquired over time and extremely rare and valuable, but I realized this would have been the creation of anti-love. **Love** now has no intrinsic value except that which you place on it; _as it should be_.

Contrary to **Love's** original concept, it will no longer increase [Renown].
