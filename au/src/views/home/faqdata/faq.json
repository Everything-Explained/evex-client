  "how do i get an invite": "# how do i get an invite\r\n\r\nInvites are given out by the Admin as well as those who have established some integrity on the site. That being said, you're free to email the Admin as described on the [about] page.\r\n\r\n[about]:#/about",
  "requirements for an invite": "# requirements for an invite\r\n\r\nAll of us are here on this planet, on this plane of existence where the majority of our time is spent figuring out what to do next. We are wanting, needing individuals. Noumenae is a place for those who don't feel they belong, who don't feel like things are \"right\". If you have strong beliefs and an open mind but aren't quite sure where you'll be welcome, then this is probably the place for you.\r\n\r\nThe Sabbath is an integral part of this site and must be at least a modicum portion of your motivation for joining. That, alongside belief in God, are the basic fundamental requirements. If you're lacking faith, but trying to find it, that's okay too. Everyone needs a place to start. Hopefully that place is Noumenae.",
  "what is a ban": "# what is a ban\r\n\r\nA ban is when a user is forced out of the site and potentially deleted. There are also temporary bans which prevent any kind of logging in until the duration is reached. Bans will be very rare and reserved for persistent inappropriate conduct and/or an outright defiance of the rules. Only Admins will have the ability to perma ban. Users that are temporarily banned will be under review by an Admin. Again, this is a last resort kind of punishment and should not be expected for the proverbial \"spilt milk\".\r\n\r\n> _No bans will be given out unless absolutely necessary_",
  "what does noumenae mean": "# what does noumenae mean\r\n\r\nNoumenae is an invented word from the root word Noumena. Noumena has a very difficult definition to wrap ones mind around, but once understood, can lead to some very fulfilling realizations.\r\n\r\nNoumena means: _Something that can be the object only of a purely intellectual, nonsensuous intuition_.\r\n\r\nIn laymens terms, you could describe this as an epiphany or experience which has no point of concievable origin however it is still very real, but unreal at the same time.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, this is the way in which our Father communicates. So what better word to use for the communication between His people than by using a term which describes His communication with us. _That is my opinion of course_.\r\n\r\nIf you want to delve into this further, here are some links:\r\n[Dictionary Definition of Noumenon][noumenon]\r\n[Kantianism][kantianism]\r\n\r\nI must stress that I DO NOT subscribe to Kantianism, but I do share in some of his philosophical beliefs, a noumenal reality being one of them.\r\n\r\n\r\n[noumenon]:http://www.dictionary.com/browse/noumenon\r\n[kantianism]:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immanuel_Kant",
  "the purpose of renown": "# the purpose of renown\r\n\r\nWith a site like this, there needs to be a way to measure contribution either physical or conceptual. Users need to know their presence has an actual impact on the family they're a part of.\r\n\r\nObviously, recieving compliments and making friends has its own reward, but being able to physically \"see\" your impact in some way, makes your experience all the more \"real\".",
  "what are messages": "# what are messages\r\n\r\nWhen you navigate to the chat panel, you will see text float up on the screen; these are messages. Messages have a number of controls that, depending on your own message count, will either be enabled or disabled. Each user must reach a certain number of messages before all these controls become enabled.\r\n\r\nThat all seems simple enough right Well...sort of. There are also 4 different _types_ of messages. There are Quips, Simple, Standard and Complex message types. From those listed types, right to left, they give increasing amounts of Renown. Complex messages give the most and Quips give the least.\r\n\r\nYou may be wondering \"Why not just make them all the same\". That's a good question. At first glance that seems the easiest solution, but because the Reonwn system istailored to recognize substantial contributions, there needs to be more strict criteria. There should be no opportunity for users to \"pad\" their renown either on purpose or accidently.\r\n\r\nAs it stands right now, only Standard and Complex messages will count towardsunlocks of features. Quips and Simple messages also have a much lower Renown benefit than their more substantial alternatives. Now, this doesn't mean that short messages are not substantial. Some of the most wise words can be said very succinctly, but the Renown system is designed to procure substantial contribution over long periods of time.\r\n\r\n_Families are not \"In n' Out\", they're forever, just like our Father in heaven._",
  "what is a like": "# what is a like\r\n\r\nThis should be reserved for an incredible contribution, generally of a personal nature. If a user likes another user, their name will appear on the profile of the user they liked.\r\n\r\n* Likes may only be given once every 2 weeks, per user.\r\n* Users must have at least 333 _standard_ messages to Like other users.\r\n* Certain modifiers may apply that recuce limitations.",
  "what is a family": "# what is a family\r\n\r\nThis is a difficult question, since it's entirely subjective. Each of us has had our own experience with family. We exist, therefore we have a family in one way or another. All I can tell you is how a family SHOULD be, not how families, in fact, are. They should be kind, understanding, and tough. That's from my own experience; your mileage may vary.\r\n\r\nNoumenae is a family, insomuch that we care for one another (at least we should) and strive to better one another by either being an example (a light) or through spirited conversation. Families are not perfect and there are going to be tensions but they should be short-lived. The better question would be, \"What's the difference between a Human family and a God family\".",
  "what is a love": "# what is a love\r\n\r\nThis should be reserved for people who have consistently contributed \"Good\" content on the site for a while; whether it's advice, news, debate, or just being an inspiration to others. This is the highest level of appreciation anyone can receive on the site.\r\n\r\n* Users can only receive love once a month.\r\n* Love can only be given once a month per user.\r\n* Users must have at least 3333 _standard_ messages before they can Love.\r\n* Certain modifiers may apply that reduce limitations.",
  "what is a kick": "# what is a kick\r\n\r\nA kick is when a user is booted from the chat server for a specific duration set by an admin or moderator. When a user is kicked, they may not log into the chat server, however they can still remain logged into their account and view the site.",
  "what is a member": "# what is a member\r\n\r\nA member is a user of noumenae who has signed up by recieving an invitation. The user, by clicking \"signup\", has agreed to the rules and became a member of noumenae through the signup page on the site.",
  "what is a notice": "# what is a notice\r\n\r\nWhen sending a message to a channel, everyone sees it. Notices allow you to single out one person in a channel and send them a message directly. The difference between this kind of message and a **private message**, is that a notice is channel-specific. You can only send a notice to a user if they're _in the same channel as you are_.\r\n\r\nYou can think of it like an inline private message to someone. It's not sent to an inbox or a special window; it's sent directly to the channel like all messages. The difference being that only the person you specified will see it, because their socket (connection) is the only one that will have access to it.\r\n\r\nYou're probably wondering _Well how do I notice someone?_ This is very simple. All you have to do is **double click** a users name in your user list. This will cause your input box to now contain a command and ID. Just start typing your message and hit enter. Don't worry about not getting a confirmation, that's just how it works right now. In the future you'll get a message saying that your notice was sent successfully.",
  "what is a silence": "# what is a silence\r\n\r\nA silence is when an admin or moderator decides to mute a user for inappropriate content or behavior. The duration of the mute depends on the severity of the infraction. Most mutes will only last 15 - 300 seconds. While a user is muted, they may view, but not participate in the chat. A silence will generally happen when a user is flooding the chat repeatedly (too quickly or with repeated content).",
  "what is a warning": "# what is a warning\r\n\r\nA warning means an Admin or Moderator has deemed a user defiant or seriously neglegent regarding the rules. Once a user accrues enough warnings more serious measures (kick, ban) will be considered.",
  "what is abuse": "# what is abuse\r\n\r\nAbuse is similar, but NOT the same as, a down-vote. Down voting assumes that the message recieving the down-vote is dissatisfactory in some way. Abuse, however, means a user has directly abused the site or a user on the site in some way. Giving an abuse modifier is not to be taken lightly and as such, will require users to input a small message as to why they are assigning abuse.\r\n\r\n* Messages may only recieve one abuse per user.\r\n* Users are required to enter a reason.\r\n  * Reasons must be at least 20 chars long\r\n  * Reasons must be no longer than 140 chars long\r\n* Users must have at least 133 _standard_ messages to assign Abuse",
  "what is nsfw": "# what is \"nsfw\"\r\n\r\nThe acronym NSFW means _Not Safe For Work_. Anything that you wouldn't share in a work enviornment is probably something you wouldn't share here. Obviously the context is very important. When dealing with something that is potentially NSFW, one should use reason and love as to whether it's appropriate for Noumenae.",
  "what is respect": "# what is respect\r\n\r\nRespect can be seen as a \"+1\" or \"upvote\" on someones message. This should only be used when a user has shared or expressed an idea or content that is deserving of your praise. Give as much as you wish, within reason :)\r\n\r\n* Rate of respect is limited to 3 per minute.\r\n* A message can only recieve one Respect per user.\r\n* A user must have at least 70 _standard_ messages to Respect",
  "what is renown": "# what is renown\r\n\r\nRenown is an abstract calculation of a users impact on the site. It can be increased through not only activity on the site, but various interactions between users.\r\n\r\nGenerally, you will aquire renown through Messages, Respect, Likes, Love, etc...",
  "what is the sabbath": "# what is the sabbath\r\n\r\nThe Sabbath, as defined in the dictionary is, in fact, the 7th day of the week. This is the day I, and many others, observe as the _\"day of rest\"_ provided us when Elohim rested from their creation. As it is written, this day was created for man, not man for the Sabbath. In other words, it's for our sake to take advantage of for our relationship with the Father as well as each other.",
  "who are associated persons": "# who are associated persons\r\n\r\nAssociated persons are only the Owner(s) and Admin(s) on Noumenae. It is important to note that Moderators and VIPs are not \"associated persons\".",

  "why did you create this site": "# why did you create this site\r\n\r\nYou should check out the [About] page.\r\n\r\n[about]:#/about",
  "why invite only": "# why invite only\r\n\r\nThere are three reasons **necessary** for this decision. The first is that there are too many people on the internet who enjoy abusing free services. That is the world we live in and as such, I must take that into consideration.\r\n\r\nThe second, is that with an invite system, we are able to filter out the individuals that might pose more harm than good to the site. This has nothing to do with abuse, but individuals that simply don't have the same moral foundation we expect out of our members and ourselves. Although the restrictions will be leniant, certain individuals will provide too much friction to be beneficial.\r\n\r\nThe third and final reason, is traffic. Early on in the development of this site, there are going to be traffic restrictions. As more and more people are added, this introduces potential for failure depending on the increase in IO on the server. Once I can assess the average strain per-user on the site, then I can remove this restriction and possibly have higher tier members start inviting more people. This is all pending overall interest, as well as our Fathers blessing.",
  "why is gaining renown slow": "# why is gaining renown slow\r\n\r\nYou need to think of Renown as something attained over a vast amount of time. If you think of Heroes or Legends having immense \"Renown\", it's because of all that they achieved in their lifetime, not a single solitary act. This is the way in which you should view Renown.\r\n\r\nEverything (almost) you do on the site, gives you a portion of Renown. Your dedication to the site and its members will reflect in your Renown. Accrue enough Renown and you just might get something special..."
