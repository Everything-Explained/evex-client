# what is a family

This is a difficult question, since it's entirely subjective. Each of us has had our own experience with family. We exist, therefore we have a family in one way or another. All I can tell you is how a family SHOULD be, not how families, in fact, are. They should be kind, understanding, and tough. That's from my own experience; your mileage may vary.

Noumenae is a family, insomuch that we care for one another (at least we should) and strive to better one another by either being an example (a light) or through spirited conversation. Families are not perfect and there are going to be tensions but they should be short-lived. The better question would be, "What's the difference between a Human family and a God family".
