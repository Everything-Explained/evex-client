# what is xp

**XP** stands for **Experience Points** and you gain them by chatting; however, _you can only gain XP every 45 seconds_. After each message you send, there is a _45 second pause_ where you can't gain anything from sending messages. Once this period has elapsed, your next message will cause you to gain XP again.

# why not gain xp for every message

This is not only to prevent spamming, but also to roughly timestamp levels. Because _you have to wait 45 seconds_, it means there's a limit on how quickly you can level. As an example, the current calculation for the first level progression is _~1 hours worth of messages_. **This prevents rapid leveling for those who have lots of time on their hands**.

> No matter how much time someone has, it will take **~1 hours worth of messages to get to level 2**.

You may be thinking that _1 hour_ isn't very much time, but that's only if you're **consistently** sending a message every 45 seconds. Most people chat in bursts and long pauses, so the chances of anyone sending a message for every 45 second period perfectly, is near impossible.
