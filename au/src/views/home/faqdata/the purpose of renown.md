# the purpose of renown

With a site like this, there needs to be a way to measure contribution either physical or conceptual. Users need to know their presence has an actual impact on the family they're a part of.

Obviously, recieving compliments and making friends has its own reward, but being able to physically "see" your impact in some way, makes your experience all the more "real".
