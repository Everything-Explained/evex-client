# what is a like

Not to be confused with how _likes_ work on other sites, **Noumenae** takes a different approach. A **Like** in the context of **Noumenae** is ___not___ a simple _"thumbs up"_ like it is for most social websites.

A **Like** should be reserved for an **impactful contribution**, generally of a personal nature. If a user likes another user, their name will appear on the profile of the user they liked.

* Likes may only be given once every 2 weeks, per user.
* Users must have at least 333 _standard_ messages to Like other users.
* Certain modifiers may apply that recuce limitations.
