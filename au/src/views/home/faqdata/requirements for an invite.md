# requirements for an invite

Noumenae is a harbor for those who feel their flesh isn't all there is, especially when that flesh is tearing at their soul. All of us are struggling with _something_, desiring a solace from worry and doubt. This restlessness that we feel from the depth of our being, this _nagging tug_...if you feel such a pull, then **Noumenae** might be what you're looking for.

We name this invisible tension _God_ or _Spirit_, the _Father_ or _Mother_, and we call it **unseen** and **unknown**. Even though we don't see and we don't know, deep down we feel we _should_ see and _should_ know. If these are the kinds of questions you're asking, the kind of life you're living, or the kind of thoughts you're pondering, then fill out the [Invitation Form].
