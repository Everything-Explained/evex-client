# requirements for an invite

All of us are here on this planet, on this plane of existence where the majority of our time is spent figuring out what to do next. We are wanting, needing individuals. Noumenae is a place for those who don't feel they belong, who don't feel like things are "right". If you have strong beliefs and an open mind but aren't quite sure where you'll be welcome, then this is probably the place for you.

The Sabbath is an integral part of this site and must be at least a modicum portion of your motivation for joining. That, alongside belief in God, are the basic fundamental requirements. If you're lacking faith, but trying to find it, that's okay too. Everyone needs a place to start. Hopefully that place is Noumenae.
