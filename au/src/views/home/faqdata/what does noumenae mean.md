# what does noumenae mean

Noumenae is an invented word from the root word Noumena. Noumena has a very difficult definition to wrap ones mind around, but once understood, can lead to some very fulfilling realizations.

Noumena means: _Something that can be the object only of a purely intellectual, nonsensuous intuition_.

In laymens terms, you could describe this as an epiphany or experience which has no point of concievable origin however it is still very real, but unreal at the same time.

In my opinion, this is the way in which our Father communicates. So what better word to use for the communication between His people than by using a term which describes His communication with us. _That is my opinion of course_.

I must stress that I DO NOT subscribe to Kantianism, but I do share in some of his philosophical beliefs, a noumenal reality being one of them.
