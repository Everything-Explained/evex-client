# what is a kick

A kick is when a user is forceably removed _from a channel_ on the chat server for a specific duration, set by an admin or moderator. A **kick** is temporary and you may join the channel again when the duration has expired.

* When you try to join a channel you were kicked from, you will be notified about how long until you can join again.
