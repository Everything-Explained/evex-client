# what is a ban

A ban is when a user is forced out of the site and potentially deleted. There are also temporary bans which prevent any kind of logging in until the duration is reached. Bans will be very rare and reserved for persistent inappropriate conduct and/or an outright defiance of the rules. Only Admins will have the ability to perma ban. Users that are temporarily banned will be under review by an Admin. Again, this is a last resort kind of punishment and should not be expected for the proverbial "spilt milk".
