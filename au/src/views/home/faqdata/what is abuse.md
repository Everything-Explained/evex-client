# what is abuse

Abuse is similar, but NOT the same as, a down-vote. Down voting assumes that the message recieving the down-vote is dissatisfactory in some way. Abuse, however, means a user has directly abused the site or a user on the site in some way. Giving an abuse modifier is not to be taken lightly and as such, will require users to input a small message as to why they are assigning abuse.

* Messages may only recieve one abuse per user.
* Users are required to enter a reason.
  * Reasons must be at least 20 chars long
  * Reasons must be no longer than 140 chars long
* Users must have at least 133 _standard_ messages to assign Abuse
