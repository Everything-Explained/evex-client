        One rule to "Rule" them all. #[em Show Love for one another];
        if you do this, then other rules become unnecessary. However, if you're a little rusty
        when it comes to dealing with other people, go ahead and keep reading.

      span.rule Language
      span.def
        span.legend
          b 1.1
          span.
            Offending members or provoking members to anger is explicity forbidden.
        span.legend
          b 1.2
          span.
            Using provocative language such as cussing or cursing will only be tolerated within
            the proper context of personal expression (when it's appropriate). Keep in mind that
            it's not appropriate most of the time.
        span.legend
          b 1.3
          span.
            Any language that violates #[b 1.1] will NOT be tolerated; this includes language
            barriers.
        span.legend
          b 2.1
          span.
            All our members have a right to be as anonymous as they wish. Provoking a member
            to divulge personal details about themselves is explicitly forbidden.
        span.legend
          b 3.1
          span.
            Currently, English is the preferred lanugage of Noumenae. If you wish to
            have a discussion in another language,
            #[i you're welcome to create your own channel on the site].
            #[b (Personal channels are still a work in progress)]


    div.rules-container.content
      span.rule Linking
      span.def
        span.legend
          b 1.1
          span All links should be constructive and non-provocative.
        span.legend

        span.legend
          b 2.2
          span.
            Images that are provocative or NSFW, should not be linked,
            talked about, or hinted at in any way.
        span.legend
          b 2.3
          span.
            A provocative or NSFW image may be discussed, or in some cases linked, #[b ONLY] if
            the context of the discussion warrants it. In such a case, the image (if linked) must be
            behind spoilers.
        span.legend
          b 2.4
          span.
            Any provocative or NSFW images that are illegal or potentially illegal are

    div.rules-container.content
      span.rule Fun
      span.def.
        #[b Have fun with it!]#[br]
        What's the point of bringing people together of similar mind and love if
        we can't find the laughter and the joy? This is what Noumenae is about; converging on the
        joy from the wellspring of our #[b God-given-love] that is within all of us, bursting out
        to be discovered. Share the passion, the heartache, and the revelation. All of it is God-within,
        letting the world know He's always been here.
        #[br]#[br]

        I'd like to think we can take our Father's example to heart;
        #[em God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son].
        Don't you think it's our duty to at least attempt a fraction of this kind of selfless love
        towards each other?
