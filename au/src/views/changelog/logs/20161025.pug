ul
  li.
    #[b Modals!!] - Not everyone knows what a modal is. It's an interactive popup
    window generated by JavaScript usually. There are CSS ones as well.

  li.
    #[b Dark Theme Forever] - Okay, so maybe not forever, but for the foreseeable
    future, the dark theme will be the default theme.

  li.
    #[b Everyone Likes to Scroll] - Dynamic scrollbars added that blend with
    the design of the site. These will be updated in the future.

  li.
    #[b Are you a Robot?] - When signing up, there will be a "Robot" check to make
    sure you're not an automated bot trying to log into the site.

  li.
    #[b Error Popups!] - Every once in a while if an error occurs, you'll get a small
    notification in the bottom right of the screen. You can click the 'X' to hide it.

  li.
    #[b Read EVERYthing] - The wording on the site has undergone many changes, so take
    your time with it, especially the FAQ.

  li.
    #[b Do you like Internet Explorer?] - I don't, and therefore there is no support for
    it currently. If you're using IE, you'll be prompted to download a "real" browser  #[i :P]#[br]
    Of course there are technical reasons why IE is not supported currently, opinions aside.

  li.
    #[b Who doesn't like Cute Sheep?] - When you hit a page that can't be found or you're
    not authorized to see, look out for the cute sheep!

  li.
    #[b New Logo and Icons] - You'll notice a brand new logo with, of course, a cute sheep.

  li.
    #[b Are you Typing?] - When a user is typing, their Nickname will blink a certain color
    in the user list. When a user pauses typing mid sentence, the Nickname will blink a
    different color.

  li.
    #[b Everyone Emotes!] - The Chat now supports emotes, not to be confused with
    emoticons. When you type the #[b /me] command followed by some text like this:
    #[b "/me likes owls"], everyone will see a special message that says
    #[b "#{'<you>'} like owls"] where #[b "#{'<you>'}"] is replaced with your Nickname.

  li.
    #[b Don't like your Nickname?] - Change it with the #[b /nick] command.

  li.
    #[b Invite Only!] - To take the strain off the current testing phase of the site,
    I've decided to make the site invite-only. This will be pending on the overall
    popularity of the site and its resources.

  li.
    #[b Sign In? What's That?] - Yes, there was no way to actually Signup or Login to the
    site. This is no longer the case. It took a lot of revisions and updates, but it's
    finally here. You can login with either a #[b Facebook] or #[b Google] (Gmail) account.#[br]#[br]
    This is a bigger discussion, but for right now, these are the only two ways to login.
    Eventually I plan on having a login system with no social-network dependency.

  li.
    #[b Did Someone Say Changelog?] - I hope you like this changelog, it will be incrementally
    updated as updates to the site come out. Do not expect this page to be updated with
    interim changes, only final changes.

  li.
    #[b Fixes] - General fixes and tuning of the site.

  li.
