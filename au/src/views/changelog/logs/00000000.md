# qol features

>- **More Readability** - Default text color was hiding too much into the background. It should be **much** easier to read now.

>- **Spacious Rules** - The rules page has a lot of good information, but it was all slammed together; each rules *"personal space"* has been increased.

>- **Consistency Abounds** - The whole site has undergone a consistency check to make sure that all margins, all text alignments, and colors are consistent with each page and action.

# chat commander redux

>- **Yes, New** - The chat commander (input box on chat page) has undergone an impressive rewrite, which leaves it almost unrecognizeable to its former self. That being said, it behaves almost identically to its previous version, however, with precision.
>- Each feature that existed before this update is still present, but now works on Firefox flawlessly. It's not only bug-free but also easier to update with new features.

>- **Play it again Sam** - After sending a message or command, it will be saved in a temporary history so that when you hit the `UP arrow` on your keyboard, the previous message or command will be immediately put back into the chat box.
>- Repeatedly hitting the `UP arrow` will cycle **up** through the history of messages or commands that you've sent. Likewise, hitting the `DOWN arrow`, will cycle **down** through the history.
>- The history only saves up to 30 items and will disappear once you navigate to another page or exit the site.

>- **Grammar Nazi Ahead!** - This feature now works across browsers. As you type, commonly misspelled words will be corrected. For instance: `teh` will be corrected to `the`. Also when typing `i` by itself, it will be capitalized to `I`.
>- At some point, this feature will be optional, but for testing purposes it will be left on until full release.

>- **Need a Hint?** - As you type a command, a hint will appear so you can quickly complete the command by hitting the `TAB` or `ENTER` key on your keyboard. This allows you to type as little as 2 or 3 characters to enter a command.
