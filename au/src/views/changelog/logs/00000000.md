>- **Scrollbars Everywhere!!** - That's right, we've got delicious scrollbars everywhere, including modals. There's currently a [discussion] about the numerous issues I've had with styling the scrollbars, while trying to maintain good functionality over multiple devices and configurations. Long story short, I had to compromise but I think it will pay off in the future.

>- **Changelog Facelift** - At first I was just going to convert all logs into [Markdown] files; that was my [goal]. But as usual I started tinkering, and ended up [bedazzling] the changelog. Oh yeah...it's quite different than it used to be, but I think it's much easier to read this way.

>- Go ahead and hover your mouse over each of these sections and you'll see something fascinating _:P_

>- **Chat styles v2** - Let's be honest, the chat window was primarily one color and blended a little too much into the interface, losing some obvious compartments. I've staggered the colors between messages, user list, and input box so that it appears more dynamic; as a result, message colors now appear more vibrant as well.

>- One of my favorite changes however, is Auto-scroll will no longer interrupt you when you try to scroll up through old messages.
>
>- Last but not least, messages sent in quick succession will simply append to the previous message block _yay!_ It was much easier than I thought it would be, however there is a caveat. Time data for those messages are lost. I will fix this in the future, but just be aware that if you repeatedly send messages before anyone replies, you will only see the time for the first message in the block.

# fixes

>- **Stop that Flicker!** - There was an issue with flickering when you navigated to the different home tab pages. This flickering was due to transitioning transparent to non-transparent colors.

>- **Transparent what?** - During the creation of the site, I had the brilliant idea to make all colors transparent for "theming" purposes, which in hindsight was...well...short-sighted _:P_
>
>- All colors have been converted to solid colors. There are no more pointless transparent colors on the site. This is a fix, because any transitions from `transparent -> solid` resulted in wonky animation.

# bits and bobs

>- **FAQ page shinanigans** - Unfortunately the faq page is in dire need of a better mechanism for displaying content. Right now I'm updating it with _raw code_, which is just annoying and leaves no room for fancy transitions between topics. This will be addressed in the next update.
